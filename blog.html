  <p>
    What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you solve them?

    The troubles I had were initially not knowing how to use SSH keys as well as downloading
    Atom and connecting it to my local repository. I also was unsure of how to connect to publish to Github Pages.
    From then on it became more simplistic since I already had some previous experience with HTML.

    What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?

    What I learned was how to push and pull from the remote repository and my local repository.
    I also learned how to use the text editor Atom more fluently. As well as use SSH keys
    to connect my local repository to the remote repository on Github.

    What resources(e.g. specific web articles, the class Piazza forum, the TAs) were most helpful
    in completing this assignment? how did you use these resources?

    I used google as well as w3schools and Piazza. I used them to research syntax
    as well as to learn to quickly set up my text editor and connect myself with SSH
    keys to Github without previously having one.
